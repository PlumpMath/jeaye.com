I built upon an existing, and well proven, cocos2d-x based game engine to integrate 3D rendering support using Ogre3D. The target platforms were Android NDK and iOS, using modern C++, which required some profiling of the rendering to achieve good performance.

I enjoyed working remotely for the whole duration of the project; it was an exciting challenge to quickly learn how to manage remote work and improve communication with detailed write ups and daily check-ins with the project lead.
