I was a member of the Marvel: Avenger's Academy game team and worked on a
variety of tasks, in modern C++, ranging from implementing game features to spec
and integrating game UI to improving core systems, such as the multi-threaded
downloader, to be safer and more robust.

Always with safety in mind, I gave talks on functional programming, pushed for
regular code reviews, standardized, safe container access, and more referential
transparency.
