Jeaye is a great developer and a team player; he is passionate about programming and it shows. From writing idiomatic C++14 code, to designing clean, safe, and documented APIs, he cares a great deal about process and would never release anything that hasn't been tested.<br/><br/>Mentoring other members of the team is something that Jeaye takes very seriously. He has organized training sessions on a variety of subjects (C++, git, debugging) and, during code reviews, always provides examples and reasoning. When conducting interviews, Jeaye is very precise in what he is looking for; ranking and the explanation of a candidate's abilities are always clear.<br/><br/>Jeaye is a really quick learner; in a couple of days, he can become the go-to person on an RFC. When in unfamiliar territory, Jeaye has a steady stance, a critical outlook, and a readiness to improve.<br/><br/>I enjoyed working with Jeaye and I hope to work with him again. He's a valuable addition to a development team and his contributions will be felt immediately.
