I worked with Jeaye at TinyCo on a game team (Tiny Monsters) and an on our
mobile engine team. He was never shy about diving into new systems, whether it
was integrating new libraries or overhauling build systems or maintaining
mission-critical code. I learned to rely on him to solve problems and get
products shipped.<br />

<br />His knowledge of modern C++ is unparalleled, his interfaces are clean and
straightforward, and his designs were always appropriate to the task at hand.
Mobile development is full of twists and turns, and he handled them like a
pro.<br />

<br />He'll be an asset to any team that needs a cool, collected, expert-level
engineer.
