Jeaye is a great developer and a team player; he is passionate about
programming and it shows. From writing idiomatic C++14 code, to designing
clean, safe, and documented APIs, he cares a great deal about process and would
never release anything that hasn't been tested.<br />

<br />Mentoring other members of the team is something that Jeaye takes very
seriously. He has organized training sessions on a variety of subjects (C++,
git, debugging) and, during code reviews, always provides examples and
reasoning. When conducting interviews, Jeaye is very precise in what he is
looking for; ranking and the explanation of a candidate's abilities are always
clear.<br />

<br />Jeaye is a really quick learner; in a couple of days, he can become the
go-to person on an RFC. When in unfamiliar territory, Jeaye has a steady
stance, a critical outlook, and a readiness to improve.<br />

<br />I enjoyed working with Jeaye and I hope to work with him again. He's a
valuable addition to a development team and his contributions will be felt
immediately.
