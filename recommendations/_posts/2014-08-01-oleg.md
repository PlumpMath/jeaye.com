Jeaye is a great developer and a team player; he is passionate about programming and it shows. From writing idiomatic C++14 code, to designing clean, safe, and documented APIs, he cares a great deal about process and would never release anything that hasn't been tested.

Mentoring other members of the team is something that Jeaye takes very seriously. He has organized training sessions on a variety of subjects (C++, git, debugging) and, during code reviews, always provides examples and reasoning. When conducting interviews, Jeaye is very precise in what he is looking for; ranking and the explanation of a candidate's abilities are always clear.

Jeaye is a really quick learner; in a couple of days, he can become the go-to person on an RFC. When in unfamiliar territory, Jeaye has a steady stance, a critical outlook, and a readiness to improve.

I enjoyed working with Jeaye and I hope to work with him again. He's a valuable addition to a development team and his contributions will be felt immediately.
