                    I worked with Jeaye at TinyCo on a game team (Tiny Monsters) and an on our mobile engine team. He was never shy about diving into new systems, whether it was integrating new libraries or overhauling build systems or maintaining mission-critical code. I learned to rely on him to solve problems and get products shipped.<br />

                    <br />His knowledge of modern C++ is unparalleled, his interfaces are clean and straightforward, and his designs were always appropriate to the task at hand. Mobile development is full of twists and turns, and he handled them like a pro.<br />

                    <br />He'll be an asset to any team that needs a cool, collected, expert-level engineer.

                    Jeaye is a highly dedicated and passionate C++ programmer. He's always got his eye on high level design considerations, and works hard to create interfaces that are easy to use. He takes pride in his work and is strongly principled, while also recognizing practical considerations that require flexibility. He is also a great teacher and learner, constantly improving his craft and sharing the wealth of knowledge both within the company and in the broader programming community.<br /><br />

                    Jeaye is a talented programmer who is dedicated to his craft. His passion for C++ is inspiring to his peers and he graciously shares his experiences and studies with his coworkers.<br />

                    <br />When tasked with important features Jeaye is a reliable employee that consistently delivers. His solutions are often elegant and highly performant. He is no stranger to multi-threading and template meta-programming, two very advanced topics within our field. Jeaye is performing well above the level one would expect from a recent graduate.<br />

                    <br />Jeaye is an active developer, even in his free time, and has shared with us some of his personal work, showcasing his strong understanding of OpenGL. Recently he has been tasked with rendering specific work which he has done a wonderful job on.<br />

<br />I highly recommend this rising star for your team, he is an excellent employee.
