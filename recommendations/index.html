From writing idiomatic C++14 code, to designing clean, safe, and documented APIs, he cares a great deal about process and would never release anything that hasn't been tested.<br/><br/>Mentoring other members of the team is something that Jeaye takes very seriously. He has organized training sessions on a variety of subjects (C++, git, debugging) and, during code reviews, always provides examples and reasoning. When conducting interviews, Jeaye is very precise in what he is looking for; ranking and the explanation of a candidate's abilities are always clear.<br/><br/>Jeaye is a really quick learner; in a couple of days, he can become the go-to person on an RFC. When in unfamiliar territory, Jeaye has a steady stance, a critical outlook, and a readiness to improve.<br/><br/>I enjoyed working with Jeaye and I hope to work with him again. He's a valuable addition to a development team and his contributions will be felt immediately.</span> </span> <img class="quote_photo" src="https://media.licdn.com/mpr/mpr/shrink_200_200/p/3/000/072/368/389b098.jpg"/></div> </section><hr/> <section itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Organization"><h3 class="position"> <a class="title" href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/smasher" target="_blank">Sean Maher</a> at <a href="http://tinyco.com" target="_blank">TinyCo</a></h3><div class="where-when"><div itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Event"> August 2012 – June 2014</div></div><div class="description" style="position:relative"> <span class="classy"> <span> I worked with Jeaye at TinyCo on a game team (Tiny Monsters) and an on our mobile engine team. He was never shy about diving into new systems, whether it was integrating new libraries or overhauling build systems or maintaining mission-critical code. I learned to rely on him to solve problems and get products shipped.<br/><br/>His knowledge of modern C++ is unparalleled, his interfaces are clean and straightforward, and his designs were always appropriate to the task at hand. Mobile development is full of twists and turns, and he handled them like a pro.<br/><br/>He'll be an asset to any team that needs a cool, collected, expert-level engineer.</span> </span> <img class="quote_photo" src="https://media.licdn.com/mpr/mpr/shrinknp_400_400/AAEAAQAAAAAAAAbfAAAAJDQ0NjQ0YmI0LTg4NGUtNDc0Ni04YTU4LWY1MzRiMWI4MjRlZA.jpg"/></div> </section><hr/> <section itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Organization"><h3 class="position"> <a class="title" href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/johnviolano" target="_blank">John Violano</a> at <a href="http://tinyco.com" target="_blank">TinyCo</a></h3><div class="where-when"><div itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Event"> August 2012 – June 2014</div></div><div class="description" style="position:relative"> <span class="classy"> <span> Jeaye is a talented programmer who is dedicated to his craft.

His solutions are often elegant and highly performant. He is no stranger to multi-threading and template meta-programming, two very advanced topics within our field. Jeaye is performing well above the level one would expect from a recent graduate.<br/><br/>Jeaye is an active developer, even in his free time, and has shared with us some of his personal work, showcasing his strong understanding of OpenGL. Recently he has been tasked with rendering specific work which he has done a wonderful job on.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this rising star for your team, he is an excellent employee.</span> </span> <img class="quote_photo" src="https://media.licdn.com/mpr/mpr/shrinknp_400_400/AAEAAQAAAAAAAAmKAAAAJDNjMmQ3NWUzLTNlZDgtNGUzNS1iMjVlLWVjYjk0MmMzNTZlNw.jpg"/></div> </section><hr/> <section itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Organization"><h3 class="position"> <a class="title" href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/matthewaorlando" target="_blank">Matthew Orlando</a> at <a href="http://tinyco.com" target="_blank">TinyCo</a></h3><div class="where-when"><div itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Event"> August 2012 – June 2014</div></div><div class="description" style="position:relative"> <span class="classy"> <span> Jeaye is a highly dedicated and passionate C++ programmer.
